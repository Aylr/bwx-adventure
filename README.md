# wwif

The Willow Wind Interactive Fiction repository was created as part of a
nine* day workshop taught at the Willow Wind Community Learning Center in
January of 2017.  It contains The Great Willow Wind Text Adventure, as well as
other smaller student creations.

###### \* Actually only six(!) days due to snow days.

## Requirements for Development

The games in wwif were developed with python 3.5.2, which can be downloaded for Windows or Mac at https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/

For Mac users (if you purchased your Mac after 2009), download the Mac OS X 64-bit/32-bit installer.

For Windows users, you'll want to double check whether you're running a 32-bit or 64-bit system.  Instructions for how to find out what system you're using can be found in this article:

  https://www.pcworld.com/article/3096790/windows/why-it-matters-whether-your-windows-is-32-bit-or-64-bit.html

For 64-bit Windows, download the Windows x86-64 executable installer.  
For 32-bit Windows, download the Windows x86 executable installer.

## Playing the Games

Once a game has reached a playable state, it will be made available as a standalone executable (an app).  You can download a game by doing the following:

1. Click on the ["dist" link](https://github.com/sleepinghungry/wwif/tree/master/dist) above.  
   "dist" is short for *distribution* and is a folder in the wwif repository that will contain games ready for distribution.
2. Click on the game that you want to download.  
   Games ending in .exe will be playable on Windows 64-bit computers.  
   Games without an ending will be playable on Mac computers.
3. Click on the "Download" button.
4. Once downloaded, you can double click on the game to play it.
