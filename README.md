# wwif

The Willow Wind Interactive Fiction repository was created as part of a
nine* day workshop taught at the Willow Wind Community Learning Center in
January of 2017.  It contains The Great Willow Wind Text Adventure, as well as
other smaller student creations.

###### \* Actually only seven days due to snow days.

## Requirements for Development

The games in wwif were developed with python 3.5.2, which can be downloaded for Windows or Mac at https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/

For Mac users (if you purchased your Mac after 2009), download the Mac OS X 64-bit/32-bit installer.

For Windows users, you'll want to double check whether you're running a 32-bit or 64-bit system.  Instructions for how to find out what system you're using can be found in this article:

  https://www.pcworld.com/article/3096790/windows/why-it-matters-whether-your-windows-is-32-bit-or-64-bit.html

For 64-bit Windows, download the Windows x86-64 executable installer.  
For 32-bit Windows, download the Windows x86 executable installer.

## Playing the Games

Once a game has reached a playable state, it will be made available as a standalone executable (an app).
