bwx-adventure
=============

A simple module for writing text adventure games in python.

This module posits a text adventure World made up of Locations. Locations are
linked by Connections and sometimes contain Things. The player is represented
by a Person object that has a current location. The command parser is simple but
is easily extened with new commands.

This was initially written in support of the Orange Band at <a href="http://sfbrightworks.org">SF Brightworks</a>.
